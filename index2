                As Mamoru Hosoda answered in the interview of his film <strong><em>Belle</em></strong> :
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                <em>
                "The Internet is in many ways a new globalized world, and I think it represents what a globalized world looks like, where language and boundaries don't play so much of a role anymore, and the metaverse is meant to really capture that sensibility.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                So I'm convinced that we need some entity or space or reality that transcends the needs of the company, and that could be the metaverse."
                </em>
