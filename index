                 As David Marriot points out in his essay 'Inventions of Existence: Sylvia Wynter, Frantz Fanon, Sociogeny, and "the Damned' "Fanon makes a certain reference to history, which he contrasts to that of invention and that of self-creation:"
                 <br>
                 <br>
                <em>
                    "I am not a prisoner of History [l'Histoire]. I should not seek there for the meaning of my destiny. I should constantly remind myself that the real leap [le v√©ritable saut] consists in introducing invention into existence.
                
                In the world through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself.""
